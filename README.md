## crowDB

crowDB is an AWS-free fork of DuckDB, designed to keep the high-performance analytical database experience while removing AWS-specific assumptions and dependencies. It stays compatible with the DuckDB codebase and SQL engine, but the project is explicitly a standalone fork called crowDB.

This repository is not the upstream DuckDB project; it is the AWS-free crowDB fork.

DuckDB is available as a [standalone CLI application](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/clients/cli/overview) and has clients for [Python](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/clients/python/overview), [R](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/clients/r), [Java](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/clients/java), and more.

For more information on using DuckDB, please refer to the [DuckDB documentation](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/).

## Installation

If you want to install DuckDB, please see [our installation page](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/) for instructions.

## Data Import

For CSV files and Parquet files, data import is as simple as referencing the file in the FROM clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM 'myfile.csv';
SELECT * FROM 'myfile.parquet';
```

Refer to our [Data Import](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/data/overview) section for more information.

## SQL Reference

The documentation contains a [SQL introduction and reference](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/sql/introduction).

## Development

For development, DuckDB requires [CMake](https://cmake.org), Python 3 and a `C++17` compliant compiler. In the root directory, run `make` to compile the sources. For development, use `make debug` or `make release` depending on your target.

Please also refer to our [Build Guide](https://duckdb.org/docs/current/dev/building/overview) and [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
